Here we aim to present some tools to make it very easy and fast to use.\n",

It is also very valuable that it can be shared with others: it can make it easier for non-scientists to understand what your work is about, it can give educators interesting tools that promote modern research, it can hook a curious student to get into sciences and so forth. Especially in education there is this problem of \"relevance\" and \"authenticity\", ie. how do things done in school relate to the students' lives or to what is actually happening in scientific research today, and using actual data from actual research (from experiments obviously unperformable in classrooms) might prove to be an important asset in closing that gap.

You could use event visualizers, spreadsheet programs, particle physics masterclass materials and what not, all of which can be found through [the Open Data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/), but the one we'll focus on here is Jupyter. You are currently reading a Jupyter notebook, an interactive file that can trivially incorporate text, pictures, animations and most importantly, code.

With Jupyter you don't have to: we can use [MyBinder](www.mybinder.org) to create a virtual workspace and get to work in a minute or two without any hassle, completely browser-based.
